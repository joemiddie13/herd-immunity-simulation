Herd Immunity Simulation Analysis

Inputs for the Simulation:

Population Size: 100,000
Percent Vaccinated: 45%
Virus Name: HIV
Mortality Rate: 30%
Reproductive Rate: 80%
Analysis of Simulation Results:

Population Size and Vaccination Details:

The simulation started with a total population of 100,000 individuals.
45% of this population, i.e., 45,000 individuals, were vaccinated against the virus from the start.
Virus Characteristics:

The virus simulated was HIV.
It had a high mortality rate of 30% and a reproductive rate of 80%.
Infection and Mortality Rates:

Percentage of Population Infected:

The log shows that 7.328% of the population became infected at some point before the virus burned out.
This equates to approximately 7,328 individuals from the original population.
Percentage of Population Deceased:

The simulation ended with 20.284% of the population succumbing to the virus.
This means 20,284 individuals died due to the virus.
Vaccination's Impact:

Total Number of Interactions:

There were 54,990 interactions recorded during the simulation.
Number of Lives Saved by Vaccinations:

A significant number of 92,672 vaccinations were administered during the simulation.
These vaccinations played a crucial role in preventing further spread of the infection and saving lives.
Conclusion:

The high reproductive rate of the virus led to a substantial number of infections early in the simulation.
Despite the high mortality rate, the large number of vaccinations administered helped curb the spread and ultimately ended the simulation with all living individuals being vaccinated.
The simulation highlights the critical role of vaccinations in controlling the spread of highly infectious diseases.
